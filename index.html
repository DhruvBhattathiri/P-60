        <img src="images%20(1).jpg">
        <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).</p>

        <h3 id="hobbies">Reading</h3>
        <img src="download.jpg">
        <p> Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.
            Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language communityâ€”which is culturally and socially situated. Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of speech) and comprehend. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or schema.</p>

        <p>Astrophysics for Young People in a Hurry(also a good book for those who like space)
            Neil DeGrasse Tyson's book, Astrophysics for Young People in a Hurry, had inspired me to become an astrophysicist. It is a 176 paged book which explains from the start of the univers to Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Enjoy!</p>
